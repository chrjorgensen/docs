## Extension Logs

To troubleshoot any issues, navigate to the **IBM i Testing** output channel and check the logs. To do this, use the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for `View: Toggle Output`. This will open the `Output` panel, where you can select the **IBM i Testing** channel.

This output channel will log which tests are discovered, what test configuration is used, all standard output/errors for any commands, and more. You can filter these logs by typing in the **Filter** search box or by using the **More Filters...** button to change the displayed log level.
