import { Aside, Icon, CardGrid, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install

The extension can be [installed from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.vscode-displayfile)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" /> and is also part of the [IBM i Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" />.

## Overview

The extension has two main pieces of functionality:

1. the ability to preview IBM i display files
2. the ability to preview IBM i printer files

Additionally, it's possible to preview..

* the entire display at one time
* specific record formats
* record formats with a subfile

## Usage

To use the renderer, open any `.dspf` (`dds.dspf`) or `.prtf` (`dds.prtf`) file in the editor. A _Preview Record_ will appear above the record format names in the source code and a _Preview all_ will appear at the top of the document. 

Click on a Code Lens to open the renderer.
