**Example 4**: Using our 'Run SQL statement' tool to summarize information.

This example shows how you can use the `Run SQL statement` tool to ask information about the data in your system. Before the tool will run any SQL statement, it will ask you to confirm that you want to run the SQL statement. This is a safety feature to prevent you from running SQL statements that could modify your data.

It will then take the result set of the statement and summarize the information based on your request.
