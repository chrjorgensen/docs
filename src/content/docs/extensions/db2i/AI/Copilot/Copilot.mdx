## Getting Started: Github Copilot

![alt text](../Copilot/image.png)

You can use GitHub Copilot, with the `@db2i` chat participant, to ask questions either about Db2 for IBM i or about specific tables in the current schema of the selected job. You can ask things like:

```text
@db2i What columns make up an employee?
```

```text
@db2i Can you get the department name for each employee?
```

```text
@db2i Write a select statement to count how many employees are in each department
```

### Install the GitHub Copilot extension

<Steps>

1. Install GitHub Copilot from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot).

2. Install the Db2 for IBM i extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.db2-for-i).
3. Connect to your IBM i system using the Code for IBM i extension.
4. Once connected, the `@db2i` chat participant is available in the chat window. You can ask questions about your database, and get help with writing SQL queries.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  Chat participants are domain experts that can answer questions about a specific topic. The `@db2i` chat participant is a domain expert in Db2 for IBM i. It can answer questions about the structure of your database, and help you write SQL queries.

### Examples

Once GitHub Copilot is installed, you can ask questions about your database using the `@db2i` chat participant. Here are some examples:


**Example 1** Summarize the columns in the `EMPLOYEE` table

This is a simple example to show how you can ask questions about the structure of your database. You can ask the chat participant to summarize the columns in a table.

**Example 2:** Get the department name for each employee

This example shows how you can ask the chat participant to write a query that joins two tables to get the department name for each employee. The chat participant will generate the SQL query for you that you can run directly in your SQL editor in VS Code.
