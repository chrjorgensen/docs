If you store your source code, or objects, in another iASP other than *SYSBAS, then your user profile needs to be configured with a job description that has the ASP set to the iASP you want to use.

There are two steps for this:

* Set the `INLASPGRP` parameter in [`CRTJOBD`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3.0?topic=ssw_ibm_i_73/cl/crtjobd.html) or `CHGJOBD` to the ASP group you want to use.
* If needed, set which job description to use in your user profile by changing the `JOBD` parameter in [`CHGUSRPRF`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3.0?topic=ssw_ibm_i_73/cl/chgusrprf.html).

Some people prefer having a user profile for each ASP.

<Aside type="note">
Code for IBM i used to have a method of setting the *source ASP* in the connection settings. It was removed in favour of this.
