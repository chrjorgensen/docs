title: Bash Shell
---

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A shell runs programs and provides a scripting language. The _Code for IBM i_ extension connects to the IBM i using the *Secure Shell (SSH) protocol*.

There are a number of shells available, but the *bash* shell is more capable than the default shell program on IBM i.

_*You must change your default shell to `bash`*_. If you do not, parts of _Code for IBM i_ will not work correctly.

## Is the Bash Shell Installed?

The easiest way is to enter `which bash` in an SSH terminal session. 

This should return `/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash`.  If it doesn't then you need to talk to you system admin about getting [IBM i Open Source Tools](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html) installed.

## Setting Bash as the Default Shell

*Some techniques come directly from the official [IBM i OSS docs page](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/SETTING_BASH.html)*

### Technique #1: Code for IBM i

When you connect to a server,  _Code for IBM i_ checks that bash is your default shell. If bash is not the default shell,  it will offer to set bash as the default.

This is the most convenient way to set bash as your default shell. You can ignore this prompt, but be aware that not all capabalities may work.

### Technique #2: chsh

1. Use yum to install the `chsh` package (for instamce, `yum install chsh`)

2. From a shell, use the `chsh` command to set your shell
  (for instance, `/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/chsh -s /QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash`).
  You can set the shell for another user via the `-u` option
  (for instance, `/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/chsh -s /QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash -u otherusr`).

### Technique #3: sql

You can set bash to be your default shell by running the following command from
anywhere you have an SQL context, such as the Run SQL Scripts tool:

```sql
CALL QSYS2.SET_PASE_SHELL_INFO('*CURRENT', '/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash')
```

You can also set bash to be the default shell for all users, by running:

```sql
CALL QSYS2.SET_PASE_SHELL_INFO('*DEFAULT', '/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash')
```

Or, for a specific user:

```sql
CALL QSYS2.SET_PASE_SHELL_INFO('OTHRUSR', '/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash')
```

More information on this IBM i service can be found on [developerWorks](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/QSYS2.SET_PASE_SHELL_INFO%20Procedure)

Also, the default shell setting can be queried out with [QSYS2.USER_INFO](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/QSYS2.USER_INFO%20catalog)


## Adding Bash to your PATH

You must have `/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash` in your PATH.  [IBM provides documentation](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/SETTING_PATH.html) on how to do this using a `.profile` or `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

Note that if you use a `.bashrc` file it must *_not_* contain any `echo` or `liblist` statements.

## Disconnect to Take Effect

After setting bash as your default shell, disconneect from the server so the change take effect.
