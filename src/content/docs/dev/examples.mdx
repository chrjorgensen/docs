## Event listener

The Code for IBM i API provides an event listener. This allows your extension to fire an event when something happens in Code for IBM i.

```ts
const instance = getInstance();

instance.onEvent(`connected`, () => {
  console.log(`It connected!`);
});
```

### Available events

| ID          | Event                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `connected` | When Code for IBM i connects to a system |
| `disconnected` | When Code for IBM i is disconnected from a system |
| `deployLocation` | When a deploy location changes |
| `deploy` | When a deploy successfully finishes |

## Running commands with the user library list

Code for IBM i ships an API (via VS Code command) that can be used by an extension to execute a remote command on the IBM i.

It has a parameter which is an object with some properties:

```ts
interface CommandInfo {
  /** describes what environment the command will be executed. Is optional and defaults to `ile` */
  environment?: `pase`|`ile`|`qsh`;
  /** set this as the working directory for the command when it is executed. Is optional and defaults to the users working directory in Code for IBM i. */
  cwd?: string;
  command: string;
}
```

* Command can also use [Promptable fields](../../developing/actions/execution/#prompted).
* When executing a command in the `ile` or `qsh` environment, it will use the library list from the current connection.

The command returns an object:

```ts
interface CommandResult {
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  code: number;
}
```

```ts
const result: CommandResult = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(`code-for-ibmi.runCommand`, {
  environment: `pase`,
  command: `ls`
});

// or

const result = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(`code-for-ibmi.runCommand`, {
  environment: `pase`,
  command: `ls`
});
```

You can also provide a custom library list and current library when executing a command in the `ile` environment:

```ts
const detail: CommandResult = {
  environment: `ile`,
  command: `CRTBNDRPG...`,
  env: {
    // Space delimited library list
    '&LIBL': 'LIBA LIBB LIBC'
    '&CURLIB': 'LIBD'
  }
}
```

## Running SQL queries

Code for IBM i has an API that lets you run SQL statements and get a result back.

```ts
const instance = getInstance();

const rows = await instance.getConnection().runSQL(`select * from schema.yourtable`);
```

## Get members and streamfiles

It is possible for extensions to utilize the file systems provided by Code for IBM i.

`openTextDocument` returns a [`TextDocument`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextDocument)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" />.

#### Getting a member

```ts
//Member located on *SYSBAS
const doc = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(vscode.Uri.from({
  scheme: `member`,
  path: `/${library}/${file}/${name}.${extension}`
}));

//Member located on an iASP
const doc = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(vscode.Uri.from({
  scheme: `member`,
  path: `/${iasp}/${library}/${file}/${name}.${extension}`,
  query: 'readonly=true' //Optional: open in read-only mode
}));
```

#### Getting a streamfile
```ts
const doc = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(vscode.Uri.from({
  scheme: `streamfile`,
  path: streamfilePath,
  query: 'readonly=true' //Optional: open in read-only mode
}));
```

#### File system options
Both `member` and `streamfile` file systems support the following query parameters:

| Name        | Type      | Description                                                  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `readonly`  | `boolean` | Open the text editor in read only mode. Defaults to `false`. |


## Connect to a system

It is possible for your API to automate connecting to an IBM i instead of the user using the connection view.

```ts
const connectionData: ConnectionData = {...};

const connected: boolean = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(`code-for-ibmi.connectDirect`, connectionData);

if (connected) {
  // do a thing.
} else {
  // something went wrong.
}
```

# VS Code integration

## Right click options

It is possible for your extension to add right click options to:

* objects in the Object Browser
* members in the Object Browser
* directories in the IFS Browser
* streamfiles in the IFS Browser
* much more

You would register a command as you'd normally expect, but expect a parameter for the chosen node from the tree view. Here is the sample for deleting a streamfile in the IFS Browser.

```ts
context.subscriptions.push(
  // `node` is the object passed in directly from the IFS Browser.
  vscode.commands.registerCommand(`code-for-ibmi.deleteIFS`, async (node) => {
    if (node) {
      //Running from right click
      let result = await vscode.window.showWarningMessage(`Are you sure you want to delete ${node.path}?`, `Yes`, `Cancel`);

      if (result === `Yes`) {
        // directory using the connection API.
        const connection = instance.getConnection();

        try {
          // Run a pase command
          await vscode.commands.executeCommand(`code-for-ibmi.runCommand`, {
            command: `rm -rf "${node.path}`,
            environment: `pase`,
          });

          vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Deleted ${node.path}.`);

          this.refresh();
        } catch (e) {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Error deleting streamfile! ${e}`);
        }
      }
    } else {
      // If it's reached this point, it usually 
      // indicates that it's running from the command palette
    }
  })
);
```

Following that, we need to register the command so it has a label. We do this in `package.json`

```json
{
  "command": "code-for-ibmi.deleteIFS",
  "title": "Delete object",
  "category": "Your extension"
}
```

Finally, we add it to a context menu:

```json
"menus": {
  "view/item/context": [
    {
      "command": "code-for-ibmi.deleteIFS",
      "when": "view == ifsBrowser",
      "group": "yourext@1"
    },
  ]
}
```

**When adding your command to a menu context**, there are lots of possible values for your `when` clause:

* `view` can be `ifsBrowser` or `objectBrowser`.
* `viewItem` can be different depending on the view:
   * for `ifsBrowser`, it can be `directory` or `streamfile`
   * for `objectBrowser`, it can be `member` (source member), `object` (any object), `SPF` (source file) or `filter`.

This allows your extension to provide commands for specific types of objects or specific items in the treeview.

## Views

Code for IBM i provides a context so you can control when a command, view, etc, can work. `code-for-ibmi.connected` can and should be used if your view depends on a connection. For example

This will show a welcome view when there is no connection:

```json
		"viewsWelcome": [{
			"view": "git-client-ibmi.commits",
			"contents": "No connection found. Please connect to an IBM i.",
			"when": "code-for-ibmi:connected !== true"
		}],
```

This will show a view when there is a connection:

```json
    "views": {
      "scm": [{
        "id": "git-client-ibmi.commits",
        "name": "Commits",
        "contextualTitle": "IBM i",
        "when": "code-for-ibmi:connected == true"
      }]
    }
```

# FAQs

## Getting the temporary library

Please remember that you cannot use `QTEMP` between commands since each command runs in a new job. Please refer to `instance.getConfig().tempLibrary` for the user temporary library.

## Is there a connection?

You can use `instance.getConnection()` to determine if there is a connection:

```ts
async getChildren(element) {
  const connection = instance.getConnection();

  let items: TreeItem[] = [];

  if (connection) {
    //Do work here...

  } else {
    items = [new vscode.TreeItem(`Please connect to an IBM i and refresh.`)];
  }

  return items;
}
```

## `connected` context

If you refer to the **Views** section, you can make it so the view is only shown when connected. This means by the time the view is used, there should be a connection.

```json
"views": {
  "explorer": [{
    "id": "yourIbmiView",
    "name": "My custom View",
    "contextualTitle": "Extension name",
    "when": "code-for-ibmi:connected == true"
  }]
}
```

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onView:yourIbmiView"
]
```
