### How do I compile my source code?

2. Open the source you want to compile.
3. Use <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+E</kbd> to compile your source.
4. If you have more than one compile option available to you for the type of source, select the appropriate one.
5. If you are using `*EVENTF`, the error listing should automatically load in the PROBLEMS tab.
